# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- Software engineering is the process of developing, testing and deploying computer applications to solve real-world problems by adhering to a set of engineering principles and best practices.
## Importance in the technology industry
- Software Engineering is important in the tech industry because it ensures software developed is of high quality and meets user expectations and needs. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- 1991: The World Wide Web was created by Tim Berners-Lee.
- 1995: JavaScript was introduced, becoming a key language for web development
- 1997: Microsoft released Windows 95, which made graphical user interfaces the standard for personal computing.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Requirement Analysis – Understanding and recording project requirements.
- Planning – Defining project scope and resources.
- Design – Creating architectural blueprints.
- Implementation – Writing the actual code.
- Testing – Identify and fix bugs to ensure software quality.
- Deployment – Releasing the software for use.
- Maintenance and Updates – Providing ongoing support and enhancements

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
### Waterfall                                                    
- Client input is required only after completing each phase.
- Changes cannot be made after the completion of a phase.
- Testing can only be performed when the complete product is ready.
- The cost of development is high.

### Agile
- Client input is required throughout the product development.
- Changes can be made at any stage.
- The testing part can be started before the development of the entire product.
- The cost of development is less.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software Developer: Designs and writes software code based on requirements.
- Quality Assurance Engineer: Carries out software testing to identify and resolve defects, ensuring software reliability.
- Project Manager: Responsible for overseeing the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
# Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):
- Provide tools for coding, debugging, and testing (e.g Visual Studio Code, PyCharm).

- Version Control Systems: Enable collaboration and code version management (e.g Git, GitHub).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Scope Creep: Occurs when a project's scope grows beyond its original plan.
### Solution
- Clearly define project requirements and stick to them.
### Security Issues
### Solution
-  Implement secure coding practices and conduct regular security audits.
### Time Constraints - Occurs when the project does not keep to its set project timelines
### Solution
-  Use efficient project management methodologies like Agile.
  
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Unit Testing – Tests individual components to ensure correctness.
- Integration Testing – Verifies interactions between combined components.
- System Testing – Tests the entire system’s functionality and performance.
- Acceptance Testing – Ensures the software meets user and business requirements before release.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- Prompt Engineering -  is the process of writing, refining and optimizing inputs to encourage generative AI systems to create specific, high-quality outputs.
### Importance
- It helps guide AI towards relevant, useful, and accurate outputs, improving efficiency in AI applications.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
### Example
  "Tell me about history."
### Effective
"Provide a summary of the key events in World War 2, including the causes, major battles, and outcomes."
